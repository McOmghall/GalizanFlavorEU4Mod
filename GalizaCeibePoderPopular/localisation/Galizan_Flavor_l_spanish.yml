 galician_area.EVTNAME1:0 "The Great Irmandiño War"
 galician_area.EVTDESC1:0 "The Great War of the Brotherhoods (Galician: Gran Guerra Irmandiña) broke out in 1467, but the formation of a \"general brotherhood\" (irmandade xeral) begun a few years earlier by Alonso de Lanzós with the backing of Henry IV of England and various municipal councils of the main Galician cities. During the war, the municipal councils became primary actors, giving the conflict the characteristics of a true civil war, rather than just a revolt, as had occurred three decades earlier.\n\nSeveral social classes participated in the organization and direction of the rebellion: peasants, city-dwellers, the lower nobility, and even some members of the clergy (some in the church hierarchy financially supported the Irmandiños). The heads of the revolt were made up of fidalgos: lower nobility and landowners.\n\nThe presence of an "avenging and anti-lord mentality" in medieval Galicia, which portrayed the great lords as "evil-doers," made the Irmandiño Wars possible. Opposed to the Irmandiños were the nobles, who had castles and forts, and the heads of the principal churches and monasteries. The Irmandiños destroyed around 130 castles and forts during the two years of war. The Lemos, Andrade and Moscoso families were the main targets of the rebels, yet the rebels spared the ecclesiastical authorities."

 galician_area.EVTNAME100:0 "The Aftermath of the Great Irmandiño War"
 galician_area.EVTDESC100:0 "The Irmandiño revolts paved the way for the centralization efforts of the Catholic Monarchs two decades later. They appointed a governor-captain general and created an audiencia for the Kingdom of Galicia to remove the dispensing of justice from the local lords and place it under the auspices of the Crown. They also ordered that none of the castles destroyed by the Irmandiños be rebuilt, and had the Galician monasteries placed under the authority of their respective Castilian orders. The Catholic Monarchs also eliminated or neutralized the powerful lords. In particular it is possible that Pedro Madruga—who remained grateful to the king of Portugal and, therefore, supported Xoana A Bertranaxa in her efforts to gain the crown of Castile against Isabella—was murdered by them in 1486. (The other possibility, depending on the chronicle, is that he died of carbuncles.) Another powerful lord, Pedro Pardo de Cela, was executed and his lands incorporated into the royal domain. Finally, Ferdinand and Isabella extended the authority of the Santa Hermandad to Galicia and abolished any remnants of serfdom in the region in 1480."
